Max's website running Gatsby, React & Node.js 

**Note**: This site was built for personal use and not as a template or theme. Feel free to draw inspiration, but the code wasn’t designed for cloning or deployment, and I don’t provide support for such purposes. For a blog setup, consider using [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/) to set up a blog or an existing theme created for that purpose.
